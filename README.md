## About

Unpublished chrome extension project currently in progress. Password Warden will offer a password generator, password strength detector, and a password manager. Currently in progress.

## Features

### Password Generator

The extension offers a customizable password generator, where users can select whether they want numbers, letters, special characters, or even specific words in their randomly generated passwords. Also has random number generators that can be used for random pin generation.

### Password Strength Detector

Based on user's password input, the extension will give the user feedback on their password strength. The strength of one's password is determined by the length, use of special characters (ie. @,!, etc), and many other factors. 

### Password Manager

Users can enter passwords they wish the extension to keep, and can access them anytime they want. The passwords will be encrypted and kept safe, secure, and private.

## Security

Password Warden has no access to the user's passwords, and will keep the user's information safe and secure.
