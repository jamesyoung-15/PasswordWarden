      <h3>What it does</h3>
      <p>
        The password generator creates a randomly made password based on the
        parameters the users checked with the option to include certain
        characters or add words into the parameter.
      </p>
      <h3>How to Use</h3>
      <p>
        Click on the checkboxes to add the characters you would like to have in
        your generated password. You can also type out the specific characters
        you would like in the "Add These Characters to List" section.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would like to increase the chance of a character being shown,
        simply repeat that character on the "Add Characters List".
      </p>
      <p>
        You can add words or phrases into the "Add Words" part which will ensure
        that your word stays together while adding the characters you selected
        around it.
