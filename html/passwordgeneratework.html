      <h3>How it Works</h3>
      <p>
        The logic behind the generator is very simple. There is a list of
        characters in the form of a string made up of characters the user has
        chosen by clicking on the checkboxes and/or adding characters throught
        the "Add Characters to List" part.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this list, the generator creates a random number between zero and
        the list length, then takes the index character of that random number
        and adds it to the password. This process repeats on a for loop until
        the password length is reached.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the user adds a word in the "Add Words to List", then the generator
        will first add the characters from the checkboxes and characters to add
        part to the list and generate the random password without the word, with
        the loop stopping at the password's length minus the word's length.
        Then, the generator inserts the word into a random position of that
        password.
